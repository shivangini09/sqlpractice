# 🗄️ My SQL Problem Solving Journey

This repository is my **personal SQL problem-solving log**.  
It contains the problems I’ve solved, my thought process, and final solutions.  
I use this repo as a **revision notebook** and **interview prep reference**.

## 📌 How I Organize

- **problems/** → Each `.sql` file = one problem with my solution.
- **notes/** → My own summaries & explanations (joins, window functions, tricky queries).
- **datasets/** → Small datasets I use to test queries.
- **README.md** → Progress tracker + quick revision.

## 🚀 My Learning Path

✅ Basics – SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOINS  
✅ Aggregations – COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING  
✅ Subqueries & CTEs  
✅ Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)  
🔄 Advanced (Optimization, Indexing, Triggers, Procedures)
