#  My SQL Problem Solving Journey

This repository is my **personal SQL problem-solving log**.  
It contains the problems Iâ€™ve solved, my thought process, and final solutions.  
I use this repo as a **revision notebook** and **interview prep reference**.

## ðŸ“Œ How I Organize

- **problems/** â†’ Each `.sql` file = one problem with my solution.
- **notes/** â†’ My own summaries & explanations (joins, window functions, tricky queries).
- **datasets/** â†’ Small datasets I use to test queries.
- **README.md** â†’ Progress tracker + quick revision.
